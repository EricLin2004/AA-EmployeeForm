# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
# 	a = EmployeeProfile.new(name: "Eric", salary: "150000", position: "Data Architect", email: "e@lin.com")
# 	b = EmployeeProfile.new(name: "Peter", salary: "145242", position: "Software Engineer", email: "p@lin.com")
# 	c = EmployeeProfile.new(name: "Darwish", salary: "135425", position: "Entrepreneur", email: "e@gani.com")
# 	d = EmployeeProfile.new(name: "Nick", salary: "145325", position: "MMA Fighter", email: "n@hong.com")
# 	e = EmployeeProfile.new(name: "Aaron", salary: "149234", position: "Start Up Guy", email: "a@rama.com")
